## Servus! I'm Rudi

- ðŸŒ± I'm a second year computer science student at the [HTBLA Leonding](https://www.htl-leonding.at/ueber-uns/) in the Computer Science International branch!
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a fun litle program that creates new song lyrics from the type of music you like!
- I develop primarily in C# and C (that is also what we learn in my college/technical highschool) and for personal projects: Python, Typescript
-âš¡ A fun fact about me is that I love to compose and play piano!
